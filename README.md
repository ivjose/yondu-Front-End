# (GitHub-Flavored) Markdown Editor

Basic useful feature list:

 * Ctrl+S / Cmd+S to save the file
 * Ctrl+Shift+S / Cmd+Shift+S to choose to save as Markdown or HTML
 * Drag and drop a file into here to load it
 * File contents are saved in the URL so you can share files


I'm no good at writing sample / filler text, so go write something yourself.

Look, a list!
